# Telos · for Kalos

> *Unofficial applicant prototype, built independently as a portfolio piece for the [Kalos Health](https://www.livekalos.com) Software Engineer role. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representing Kalos Health. All member data shown is synthetic. The "Kalos" brand and product references appear here as context for the role being applied to.*

**An AI continuity layer between DEXA scans.**

Members track and confide. Performance Analysts get AI-prepared briefs, triage signals, and reviewable draft messages — designed to work with Kalos's coaching corpus only after consent, governance, and data access are in place. The gap between scans is where momentum compounds or dies. Telos is the design for filling that gap.

Built as a working prototype for the [Kalos Health](https://www.livekalos.com) Software Engineer role.

> *Telos* — Greek τέλος, "the goal you're working toward."

*Performance → AI Inbox — the headline feature: AI-drafted member messages awaiting analyst review, with a live Claude-backed draft generator. Every draft is reviewable, editable, and approval-gated before send. Pattern-matched against 2,840+ synthetic coaching arcs in this demo. Captured against the deployed Vercel build; you can see the `LIVE · CLAUDE` badges, model identifier (`claude-haiku-4-5`), and per-draft confidence labels populate in real time.*

## Tour in under 2 minutes

If you want to evaluate this without poking around blindly, here's the fastest path to the substance:

1. **Overview page** — scroll halfway down to *"Performance Analysts · The Human Edge."* That section is Telos's positioning vs. Kalos's refund-backed AI promise. *(~15 sec)*

2. **Member tab → Telos** — read Maya's between-scan chat. Type a reply mentioning *"protein"* or *"sleep"* and watch it respond contextually. *(~30 sec)*

3. **Performance tab → AI Inbox** — three reviewable draft messages for James, awaiting analyst approval. Click **Approve & Send** on one to see the state machine. Then click **✨ Generate Live Draft** at the top — that calls Claude Haiku 4.5 via the `/api/draft-message` serverless function and returns a fresh, real-time AI-drafted message in the same shape as the static seeds, ready for the same approve / edit / decline flow. This is work-stream #3 *actually working*, not mocked. *(~30 sec)*

4. **CAMA Proof tab** — the strongest single artifact. An analyst insight, the patterns it was derived from, and the underlying memory records that produced those patterns. Click any pattern chip to see exactly which memories CAMA associated — no claim is opaque. *(~45 sec)*

5. **Member tab → DEXA Report** — click between Scan #1 → Scan #6 in the picker. The body-scan SVG, segmented region labels, and visceral hotspot all update per scan. *(~15 sec)*

6. **Theme dropdown** in the header — 7 palettes including Kalos's actual royal blue. Switch to *Galaxy* or *Aurora* to see the design system shift. *(~10 sec)*

7. *(Optional, ~5 min)* **[`BUILD_PLAN.md`](./BUILD_PLAN.md)** — 7-phase production roadmap with stack choices, timelines, risks, and the four conversations I'd want in week one before committing to phasing.

## What it is

Kalos's [software engineer job posting](https://www.livekalos.com/careers/software-engineer) describes three engineering work streams. Telos is a working prototype of **work-stream #3**:
*"AI-powered internal tools trained on thousands of real coaching conversations."*

Built in Kalos's own stack and design system:

- **TypeScript + React 19 + Vite**
- **Manrope** (Kalos's actual font)
- **Royal blue #4570FF** primary (Kalos's actual brand color, resolved from their stylesheet)
- All copy pulled from [livekalos.com](https://www.livekalos.com): "Your scan becomes a plan," "Real members. Real DEXA data. Real delta," "Performance Analysts. Not technicians."

## What's in it

**6 top-level pages:**

- **Overview** — hero with the Kalos Triangle (Muscle / Fat / Symmetry), real member testimonials (verbatim from livekalos.com), the "Telos amplifies your analyst, never replaces them" positioning that answers Kalos's refund-backed AI promise
- **Member** — 11 tabs covering the full member experience:
  Today · Schedule · Body · DEXA Report · Nutrition · Movement · Sleep · Telos chat · Apps · Find Your Analyst · Onboarding · Suggestions
- **Performance** (analyst side) — Today's AI-prepared schedule, AI Inbox of draft messages, Caseload, My Performance dashboard, Kalos Standards protocol library, Suggestions
- **Privacy** — dual-view "pattern, not text" architecture explainer
- **CAMA Proof** — end-to-end provenance trace: analyst insight → derived patterns → underlying memory records, all with synthetic data
- **Platform** — stack overview + builder bio

**Notable working interactions:**

- Live chat with contextual responses (Member → Telos tab)
- AI Inbox draft-message review with approve / edit / decline state (Performance → AI Inbox)
- 6-scan DEXA report with click-to-switch scan picker — body scan SVG, segment values, and visceral hotspot all update per scan
- Analyst Match quiz that maps members to one of 14 real Kalos Performance Analysts
- **CAMA Proof Layer** — click a pattern chip on the analyst insight to highlight the exact memory records it was derived from; click a derived pattern card to dim everything that didn't contribute
- 7 theme palettes (Kalos · Cyber · Aurora · Galaxy · Mono · Sage · Crimson) with live switching
- Functional feedback form on both Member and Performance sides

## Brand honesty notes

- **Wearable integrations are clearly labeled as roadmap** (Apple Health Q2, Whoop Q2, Oura Q3, Lingo Q3). Kalos doesn't ship these today and the demo doesn't pretend otherwise.
- **Sauna / cold plunge / mobility class references removed** — Kalos is a DEXA + coaching clinic, not a wellness spa.
- **Compensation tracker dollar amounts show "$ —"** — the feature surface is there, synthetic dollars are not.
- All member and cohort data is synthetic. A `LIVE DEMO` chip is visible in the header at all times.

## Live AI draft generation

The static AI Inbox seeds (Maya, Daniel, Priya) demonstrate the analyst-review state machine. The **✨ Generate Live Draft** button at the top of the AI Inbox does the live version: it calls the Anthropic Claude API server-side and returns a fresh draft in real time, in the same shape as the static seeds, ready for the same approve / edit / decline flow.

**Architecture:**

```
React UI (InboxView)
    ↓  POST /api/draft-message  { memberName, trigger, metrics, recentMessages? }
Vercel serverless function (api/draft-message.ts)
    ↓  Anthropic SDK · claude-haiku-4-5
Claude API
    ↓  structured JSON { body, conf, reasoning }
Server response { id, member, init, draftedAt, body, conf, source, live: true, meta: {model, tokens} }
    ↓
UI prepends to drafts grid · LIVE · CLAUDE chip · same approve/edit/decline buttons
```

**Three pre-set scenarios** rotate per click — distinct from the static seeds so live drafts are visibly *new* alongside them:
- *Sam K.* — first-week slip, tests "supportive accountability not strict correction"
- *Jordan T.* — plateau despite 100% adherence, tests technical recommendation depth
- *Alex M.* — disclosed work + family stress, tests tone-softening + minimum-effective protocol

**System prompt** (excerpt) embeds the Kalos coaching principles: supportive accountability, pattern-not-text disclosure, no medical claims, defer to analyst judgment. Full prompt in [`api/draft-message.ts`](./api/draft-message.ts).

**Setup for the live API:**

1. `cp .env.example .env.local`
2. Add an Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) to `.env.local`
3. For local testing: `vercel dev` (the `/api` routes do not run under plain `vite`)
4. For production: set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables

The frontend client (`src/api/draftClient.ts`) returns a discriminated union (never throws) and maps server errors to user-readable messaging — when the API key isn't configured, the analyst sees a clear "not configured on this deployment" notice instead of a crash.

## CAMA Proof Layer

The hardest claim in this prototype is that AI memory of coaching context can be useful *and* auditable. The `/cama` page is the proof.

**Three layers, fully referenced:**

```
CoachInsight  →  Pattern[]  →  MemoryRecord[]
   (output)      (derived)        (source)
```

An analyst-facing insight cites the Patterns it was built from. Each Pattern cites the MemoryRecords it was associated from. Click any layer to trace it down. No insight is opaque — every claim has receipts.

Every MemoryRecord carries: `member_id`, `memory_type`, `timestamp`, `source`, `content`, `tags`, `confidence`, `provenance`, `durability`. Memory types include `dexa_summary`, `analyst_note`, `food_log`, `checkin`, `goal`, `setback`, `preference`.

The data is fabricated, modeled after public coaching workflows. No Kalos member data is used anywhere. The same architecture would apply to approved coaching data only after consent, governance, data access, and audit-logging are in place — see [`BUILD_PLAN.md`](./BUILD_PLAN.md) for the production rollout sequence.

The provenance contract is enforced by tests: every `Pattern.derivedFrom` id and every `AnalystInsight.patternIds` reference is verified at test time, so the audit chain cannot quietly break.

## Production readiness

Telos is a **front-end product prototype** built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS 4. It uses synthetic data only and does not connect to any Kalos system.

**Implemented today:**
- Typed React/Vite app structure with strict TypeScript (`tsc -b` clean, `eslint .` clean, `vite build` clean)
- Domain types in [`src/types/`](./src/types) — `Member`, `DexaScan`, `AnalystBrief`, `MessageDraft`, `Session`, etc.
- Mock API layer in [`src/api/`](./src/api) — async-typed boundaries so the UI never reaches into raw data files
- **Live AI draft generation** via Vercel serverless function ([`api/draft-message.ts`](./api/draft-message.ts)) calling Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 — real-time drafts in the same shape as the static seeds
- Componentized member + analyst workflows (~25 components, 6 pages, 11 member tabs, 6 analyst tabs)
- Synthetic DEXA, wearable, nutrition, and coaching data behind the API layer
- Analyst review/approve/decline state machine for AI-assisted drafts (works for both static seeds and live-generated)
- Privacy-aware member disclosure pattern (`pages/DataArch.tsx`)
- Theme system with 7 palettes + localStorage persistence + legacy-key migration
- Responsive on tablet and desktop; mobile layout in progress.
- Public GitHub repo + auto-deploy via Vercel on push to `main`
- Vitest + React Testing Library set up with smoke + behavior tests (34 tests, 5 suites)

**Production path (what shipping this for real would require):**

| # | Work | Time est. |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Replace synthetic data with API-backed models (Node + Hono + Postgres + Drizzle) | 4–6 wks |
| 2 | Authentication + role-scoped authorization (member / analyst / admin) | 1 wk |
| 3 | Audit logging for AI-generated drafts and analyst approvals | 1 wk |
| 4 | Consent + governance layer before training on coaching corpus | 2 wks |
| 5 | Fine-tune model on Kalos's actual coaching corpus | 4–6 wks |
| 6 | HIPAA-ready hosting (BAA), encryption-at-rest, SOC 2 evidence collection | 4 wks |
| 7 | Native mobile (React Native, HealthKit, BLE) | 6–8 wks |

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev           # dev server on http://localhost:5181
npm run build         # type-check + production build
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm test              # Vitest, runs all suites once
npm run test:watch    # Vitest in watch mode
```

Production bundle: ~406 kB JS / ~33 kB CSS (gzipped ~117 kB / ~7 kB).

On Windows there's also a `Telos.bat` launcher on the Desktop — one click starts the dev server and opens the browser.

## Test coverage

34 tests across 5 suites verify the parts that have to be right:

- **`src/api/telosApi.test.ts`** — API surface: members CRUD, DEXA trajectory invariants, AI Inbox approve / decline state machine, analyst matching algorithm, integrations honesty (live vs roadmap), schedule ordering
- **`src/api/draftClient.test.ts`** — live AI draft client contract: error mapping (config / network / validation / model), request shape, never-throw guarantee
- **`src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.test.tsx`** — theme persistence to localStorage, migration from the legacy `companion.theme` key, dropdown interaction
- **`src/pages/DataArch.test.tsx`** — privacy invariant: analyst's view contains pattern + signal but never the member's raw disclosure text
- **`src/pages/CamaProof.test.tsx`** — provenance integrity: every Pattern.derivedFrom and AnalystInsight.patternIds reference resolves; UI trace works end-to-end

Run with `npm test`.

## Why it exists

Kalos's job posting names work-stream #3 as *"AI-powered internal tools trained on thousands of real coaching conversations."* This demo is a working front-end prototype of that direction — built solo in their stack, brand language, and product voice. The AI layer is illustrated through synthetic interactions; the model itself would be designed and trained in collaboration with Kalos once consent, governance, and data access are in place. Intent: show what a second engineering hire would ship.
